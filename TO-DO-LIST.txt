TO DO LIST
done! change labels to make them more obvious and also change default values

done! save chosen values of parameters in a local file (json?)
retrieve values from file. Almost there, need to package nicely to make it flexible

idea: parameters that have to be dynamic and saved by user should be flagged
and the saved and loaded via JSON text file saved locally - almost useless

fix git web main page to reflect different libraries etc
