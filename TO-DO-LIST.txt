TO DO LIST:
sliders: switch instead of slide if boolean
coloring as option
length of escape route to color inside?
check entered functions, perhaps make input user friendly
pass parameters as URL

  

GENERIC
readme file for git
about page
mimic what I have done in polar fuctions, consoldidate loadvalues
save functions when saving file, at the moment is undefined
parameter: update immediately after change ON/OFF - makes sense for grids and othe ops where there's no waiting


2D, cleanup

3D COLOR - major WIP
- make pavement static and larger, possibly with dynamic angles
- z factor (0-1], not range
- pavement grid depends only on chosen resolution
- drop down with functions
- enter/update function


wip: 3d-color wip page. think about having several
functions and see if they can be saved in the params
also, the function launched by the go button should be dynamic

ROTATIONS (COMPLEX PLANE)
add params (for sure) and save?
don't wipe when changing vector? think about it
list of selected points with possibility of deleting from array
when over the list highlight corresponding dot
red dots before starting the animation
lock to 1 radius
color change w radius? or magnitude

MODULES
description of page
better details on factor in R+ (and not N)

POLAR 
bug when changing x0,x1 through sliders
grid bug when zooming out 

FRACTALS
better binding of sliders to params

  JULIA
  in the event listener I need to go through the object returned by the drop down change
  update the parameters and reload/go
perhaps it's worth writing a function that updates 
one object properties starting from another object having the same prop names 
destructuring?
 - EXTENDED JULIA
   fix parameters' choices


in the test page
 bind the drop downs in cascade
 dd1: functions
  dd2: examples of k, boundaries etc




BURNING SHIP
red vectors?
TREE
fractal tree fuctions remove px, py?
