TO DO LIST:

3d polar

coloring as option
length of escape route to color inside? find formula or give up
check entered functions, perhaps make input user friendly
pass parameters as URL
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams
pan all directions?
remove save and do a link instead?

GENERIC
readme file for git
about page
mimic what I have done in polar fuctions, consoldidate loadvalues
save functions when saving file, at the moment is undefined
after slider is updated via software the recalc function is not triggered
go button - on/off via params

2D, cleanup
---------------------------------------------------------------
3D COLOR - major WIP
vertical pavement 
 - what to do when it's not in the origin
 - make it parametric to any vertical plane.
 - on/off
 - decide height depending on z range, - z factor (0-1], not range
 - c1, c2 as parameters?

graphic improvements:
- x,y,z on axis, perhaps arrow points too
. assi ben visibili
- pavement grid depends only on chosen resolution
- enter/update functions
- ctx.globalAlpha = 0.5; //opacity : make dynamic
- auto pan to better fit - ahhhh
- line width, once for all
- zoom out shrinks everything?

---------------------------------------------------------------
ROTATIONS (COMPLEX PLANE)
add params (for sure) and save?
don't wipe when changing vector? think about it
list of selected points with possibility of deleting from array
when over the list highlight corresponding dot
red dots before starting the animation
lock to 1 radius
color change w radius? or magnitude

MODULES
description of page
better details on factor in R+ (and not N)

POLAR 
bug when changing x0,x1 through sliders
grid bug when zooming out 

FRACTALS
better binding of sliders to params

  JULIA
  in the event listener I need to go through the object returned by the drop down change
  update the parameters and reload/go
perhaps it's worth writing a function that updates 
one object properties starting from another object having the same prop names 
destructuring?
 - EXTENDED JULIA
   fix parameters' choices
