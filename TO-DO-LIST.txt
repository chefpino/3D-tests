TO DO LIST 
resolution of sliders: add values of "steps" in params object
if declared integer the number of steps should be max-min
attendere prego!

ideas:

  fourier?
  generic: update intervals after zoom? if not the go button should act like a zoomOut
  

GENERIC
fix once for all CSS
json to menu: add active element css class?
readme file for git
customize action for each slider?

2D, cleanup

3D COLOR
- make pavement static and larger, possibly with dynamic angles
- z factor (0-1], not range
- pavement grid depends only on chosen resolution
- drop down with functions
- enter/update function


wip: 3d-color wip page. think about having several
functions and see if they can be saved in the params
also, the function launched by the go button should be dynamic

ROTATIONS (COMPLEX PLANE)
add params (for sure) and save?
don't wipe when changing vector? think about it
list of selected points with possibility of deleting from array
when over the list highlight corresponding dot
red dots before starting the animation
lock to 1 radius
color change w radius? or magnitude

MODULES
description of page
better details on factor in R+ (and not N)


FRACTALS
better binding of sliders to params


  JULIA
  in the event listener I need to go through the object returned by the drop down change
  update the parameters and reload/go
perhaps it's worth writing a function that updates 
one object properties starting from another object having the same prop names 

in the test page
 fix escape route to reflect selected function
 bind the drop downs in cascade
 dd1: functions
  dd2: examples of k, boundaries etc




BURNING SHIP
red vectors? 

  TREE
fractal tree fuctions remove px, py?

  BARNSLEY
  add zoom function?
