TO DO LIST
done! change labels to make them more obvious and also change default values

done! save chosen values of parameters in a local file (json?)
retrieve values from file. Almost there, need to package nicely to make it flexible

idea: parameters that have to be dynamic and saved by user should be flagged
and the saved and loaded via JSON text file saved locally - almost useless

wip: 3d-color wip page. Add parameters and think about having several
functions and see if they can be saved in the params
also, the function launched by the go button should be dynamic
the z stretching doesn't make sense at the moment

fix git web main page to reflect different libraries etc

add parameters library to tree-enhanced fractal
almost done, check after loading file why doen't trigger a redraw

move updateparams and loaddefaults functions to controls.js

fix default parameters of burning ship fractals

fix PI in tree parameters

show function in fractals ex. Zn+1=(Zn)^2+C etc

Julia set 

mapping of unit circle, move to fractals folder

fix once for all CSS

fix positions of script withing the page, I hate having it after the body

draw axis function, make more generic
