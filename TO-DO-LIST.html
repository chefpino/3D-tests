IDEAS
3d solids - perhaps points in 3d
polar 2d fix resolution not ad dt but as res
coloring as option
pass parameters as URL
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams
save a url link. access clipboard? loadvalues is the point to choose from.
matrices page: enter, transpose, determinant? cazzata?
idea: slider-like countdown during long calculations - difficult
autoreload for fractals on/off
//-------------------------------------------
GENERIC
fix grids that are horizontal and vertical by centering them on 0.5x0.5 grid
2D, cleanup - fix function colors, perhaps different color for each function
fix layers size in 2d functions
** math library with constants and abbreviations of trigonometric functions
** optimize loadvalues() functions
*** in perspective don't plot when y is less than 0?
//-------------------------------------------
3D COLOR - major WIP
 - pavement should be centered around axis, now it's off as it starts from the edges of the domain
 - coloring
 - improve distance from screen in perspective function, diagonal doesn't work
 - improve arrowHead?
graphic improvements:
- bug: if the intervals are small the overall image is too small even with max zoom
- auto pan to better fit - ahhhh
---------------------------------------------------------------
ROTATIONS (COMPLEX PLANE)
don't wipe when changing vector? think about it
list of selected points with possibility of deleting from array
lock to 1 radius
---------------------------------------------------------------
POLAR 
bug when changing x0,x1 through sliders
grid bug when zooming out
---------------------------------------------------------------
EXTENDED JULIA
   fix parameters' choices
   in the event listener I need to go through the object returned by the drop down change
   perhaps it's worth writing a function that updates 
   copy from JULIA page
---------------------------------------------------------------
MANDELBROT
Check page structure and order of variables loading etc
