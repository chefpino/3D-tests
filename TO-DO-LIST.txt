TO DO LIST

json to menu: add active element css class, use key to identify active

idea: flag parameters that have to be dynamic and saved by user should be flagged
and the saved and loaded via JSON text file saved locally - almost useless

wip: 3d-color wip page. think about having several
functions and see if they can be saved in the params
also, the function launched by the go button should be dynamic
the z stretching doesn't make sense at the moment

add parameters library to tree-enhanced fractal
almost done, check after loading file why doen't trigger a redraw

move updateparams and loaddefaults functions to controls.js

fix default parameters of burning ship fractals

fix PI in tree parameters

show function in fractals ex. Zn+1=(Zn)^2+C etc

some sort of zoom function for the fractals

Julia set 

description of each page

fix once for all CSS

fix positions of script withing the page, I hate having it after the body

draw axis function, make more generic?
