TO DO LIST
remove console.log s
resolution of sliders? TAI

GENERIC
description of each page
navigation menu, improve graphic
fix once for all CSS
another home page beside the default github one?
json to menu: add active element css class?
clear canvas could be a method of remap

3D COLOR
wip: 3d-color wip page. think about having several
functions and see if they can be saved in the params
also, the function launched by the go button should be dynamic
the z stretching doesn't make sense at the moment

COMPLEX PLANE
  add save params?
  description of how to use the page
don't wipe when changing vector? think about it
list of selected points with possibility of deleting from array
remove last points, think about it
red dots before starting the animation
lock to 1 radius
color change w radius?



FRACTALS
need to update displayed params after zooming - better binding of sliders to params
save fixed center among params, save file after zooming, include other params
double-click zoom out (messy to deal with double click)
separate functions for zoomIn and zoomOut


  MANDELBROT
  clean mandelbrot code, useless functions for other fractals
  second layer on top to see (on mouse move) the escape route of each points
