IDEAS
3d solids - perhaps points in 3d
polar 2d fix resolution not ad dt but as res
coloring as option
pass parameters as URL
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams
save a url link. access clipboard? loadvalues is the point to choose from.
matrices page: enter, transpose, determinant? cazzata?
autoreload for all fractals on/off
shading/ray-tracing
//-------------------------------------------
GENERIC
fix grids that are horizontal and vertical by centering them on 0.5x0.5 grid
2D, cleanup - fix function colors, perhaps different color for each function
fix layers size in 2d functions
** math library with constants and abbreviations of trigonometric functions, add to pages
** optimize loadvalues() functions
*** in perspective don't plot when y is less than 0?
fix perspective function for negative y
complete description of pages
c -> c modules darker lines
//-------------------------------------------
3D COLOR - major WIP
 - pavement should be centered around axis, now it's off as it starts from the edges of the domain
 - coloring
 - improve distance from screen in perspective function, diagonal doesn't work
 - improve arrowHead?
graphic improvements:
- bug: if the intervals are small the overall image is too small even with max zoom
- auto pan to better fit - ahhhh
---------------------------------------------------------------
ROTATIONS (COMPLEX PLANE)
list of selected points with possibility of deleting from array
lock to 1 radius and limit number of repetitions
---------------------------------------------------------------
POLAR 
bug when changing x0,x1 through sliders
grid bug when zooming out
move functions on top of panel
---------------------------------------------------------------
