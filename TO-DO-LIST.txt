TO DO LIST


3D COLOR
wip: 3d-color wip page. think about having several
functions and see if they can be saved in the params
also, the function launched by the go button should be dynamic
the z stretching doesn't make sense at the moment

COMPLEX PLANE
  add save params?
  description of how to use the page
don't wipe when changing vector? think about it
list of selected points with possibility of deleting from array
remove last points, think about it
red dots before starting the animation
lock to 1 radius
color change w radius?



FRACTALS
need to update displayed params after zooming - better binding of sliders to params
save fixed center among params

save file after zooming, include other params
double-click zoom out
separate functions for zoomIn and zoomOut
finally remove sliders for x0,x1,etc - use params but do not display

color on/off - different coloring system log vs linear etc. current coloring function is not great

  BURNING SHIP
  fix default parameters of burning ship fractals
  option of b/w

  TREE
  fix PI in tree parameters
  
  MANDELBROT
  clean mandelbrot code, useless functions for other fractals

GENERIC
description of each page
fix once for all CSS
fix positions of script withing the page, I hate having it after the body
another home page beside the default github one?
json to menu: add active element css class?
clear canvas could be a method of remap
