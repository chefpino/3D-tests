TO DO LIST
remove console.log s
resolution of sliders? TAI

GENERIC
fix once for all CSS
another home page beside the default github one?
json to menu: add active element css class?

3D COLOR
wip: 3d-color wip page. think about having several
functions and see if they can be saved in the params
also, the function launched by the go button should be dynamic
the z stretching doesn't make sense at the moment

COMPLEX PLANE
  add save params?
don't wipe when changing vector? think about it
list of selected points with possibility of deleting from array
remove last points, think about it
red dots before starting the animation
lock to 1 radius
color change w radius? or magnitude

FRACTALS
better binding of sliders to params
save fixed center true/false among params, save file after zooming, include other params
double-click zoom out (messy to deal with double click)
separate functions for zoomIn and zoomOut


  MANDELBROT
  clean mandelbrot code, useless functions for other fractals

  JULIA
  add possible parameters with their x0,x1
  added examples in the params object, must add values from
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set
  and have a drop down linked to it
  I have the dropdown functions ready and linked to juliaexamples
  in the event listener I need to go through the object returned by the drop down change
  update the parameters and reload/go
perhaps it's worth writing a function that updates 
one object properties starting from another object having the same prop names 

 

  TREE
  parameters of leaves?
  fractal tree fuctions remove px, py

  BARNSLEY
  add zoom function
